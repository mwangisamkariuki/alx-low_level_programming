#Task 0: 0. strcat
	Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
#Task 1:1. strncat
	Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
	it will use at most n bytes from src; and
	src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
#Task 2:strncpy
	Write a function that copies a string
	Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	our function should work exactly like strncpy
# Task 3:
