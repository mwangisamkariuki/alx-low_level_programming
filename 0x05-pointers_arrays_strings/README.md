# Task 0:
    Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
# Task 1:
    Swap 2 values through a function void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
    you do this by creating a temp variable within the function
    to hold the value of one int as you swap the other variable address
# Task 2:
    Culculate the length of a given string using the function Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
# Task 3:
    prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
    using the prototype void _puts(char *str);
# Task 4:
    prints a given string in the reversed order
# Task 5:
    prints a given string in the corect order and then in a reversed order
# Task 6:
    A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
# Task 7:
    Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
    Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
# Task 8:
    Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
    Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
# Task 9:
    a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
    Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
